                <h1>Hi, I am Sunny! ✌️</h1>
                <p>I am an artist and programmer who creates digital art and interactive installations. I use code to create art that explores the relationship between humans and technology. My work often deals with themes of surveillance, control, and power. I am interested in how technology can be used to create new ways of seeing and experiencing the world. I have a background in computer science and art, and I use this knowledge to create art that is both visually stunning and intellectually stimulating.</p>
                <p>I studied Creative Technologies at the Filmuniversity Babelsberg. The rest is history!</p>
